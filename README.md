# Flight-club
In the kiwi.com, the flight search is made.
According my requirements i created a flight search including its start time, end time, destination, and other important things to be considered.
The flight-data is taken from the open-source sheety files and stored here.
If the flights are available according to our requirements then the notifications are send to us with the sms or email using the Twilio platform.
